    <p>Today was a pretty meh day(not unlike the las few months). Life without school is prety boring. My family and I usually go out everyday. Sometimes,we go to the beach,else we go to mall etc. Today I took up HTML for the first time in quite a few years. Have to say , after much more technical languages like C# , this is peice of cake.</p>
