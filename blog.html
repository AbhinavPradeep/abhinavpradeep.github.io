        <p>Todays a hot day.it's like at least 30<sup>o</sup> oustside. The visibility today is beautiful. You can
            easily
            see the ocen from my window.</p>
        <p>Today was a pretty meh day(not unlike the las few months). Life without school is prety boring. My family and
            I
            usually go out everyday. Sometimes,we go to the beach,else we go to mall etc. Today I took up HTML for the
            first
            time in quite a few years. Have to say , after much more technical languages like C# , this is peice of
            cake.
